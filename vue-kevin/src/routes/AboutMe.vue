      Welcome to my informational web page! I'm me and 23 years old (b. 1993) and live in New York City (from Louisiana). You can explore my work down there below. I'm interested in restraint, observation, refraction, repetition, decay, growth. I prefer to
      work across different forms and like to say "it's all one thing."
