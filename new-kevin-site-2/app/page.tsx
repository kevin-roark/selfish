        I am 30 years old (April 11, 1993) and live in Brooklyn, NY.
        I am from Slidell, LA.
        I enjoy playing basketball, "my little research projects," reading, riding my bike, eating and drinking.

        I work for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brooklynnets/?hl=en" target="_blank">Brooklyn Nets</a> in the front office.
        My title is funny: Director of Basketball Systems and Innovation.
        Our group is responsible for putting together the team's roster via the Draft, Free Agency, and Trades.
        I use computer, design, and critical thinking skills to enhance and streamline the work of everyone else, like scouts and analysts.
        Mostly it is fun and interesting work. I like the scope and duration of the problem, and I love basketball.
      </p>

        I work on other things tooâ€”photographs, videos, websites, "link knots," sounds. You can see details in the projects page below.
        I used to do this stuff way more, but I had some kind of mental breakdown / "the yips" style behavior in the summer of 2017 after
        showing "It's Coming a Storm" at Harvestworks that, upon reflection, was a result of not dealing with a series of personal and
        emotional issues stemming from my _unusual_ childhood. I've been working on those issues recently and am doing much better, but it is a "day at a time."
        I am grateful for all of the love and support in my life. I have been doing my media / research work off-and-on in private since then
        and am going to be sharing it here moving forward.

        I am an advocate for <a href="https://adultchildren.org/" target="_blank">Adult Children of Alcoholics / Dysfunctional Families (ACA)</a>.
        I go to a meeting every Tuesday in Carroll Gardens, hit me up if you ever want to come.
        I really love to spend time with my friends. I have three siblings: Laurie (24), Moses (16), Isabella (14). I love them too.
