  A red curtain opens. It reveals another red curtain. That red curtain opens. It reveals another red curtain. 1,000 times. The new world copies the old in too many ways. Things repeat and reversion themselves. A powerpoint on the library’s shared computer is named Presentation.ppx and then Presentation 1.ppx and then Presentation 2.ppx and then Presentation Final.ppx and then Presentation Final B.ppx. It is relentless. I print a document. I change a word in the digital copy. What then? I want to be myself for halloween, scan and print a mask of me and then when Halloween ends build that character in an online world. I found money on the ground in Montauk. I wondered how many hands it touched. My Bio changed. Once Nigel and I played WWE on the PS3 (Not the 2, Not the 4) and we recreated Sonny Moore (Skrillex) with the create-a-character feature. I watched him hit another wrestler’s body with a ladder. Kevin Roark DM’d me on Twitter. He lives in Texas. My dad took me to a wrestling match at the New Orleans Arena when I was 11 and all of the wrestlers were fake versions of the wrestlers I knew from TV, I liked it better on TV, I liked it better with another layer, it was all too physical. Ender’s Game. I read every Animorphs. I get an email with my name in it but I know it was sent to 1,000 other people that are like me and that are not like me. It’s only smart to buy in bundles: individual items are too low-margin. I have paper towels from Box Dot Com rotting under my sink. Diversify everything. You have a “type” that you like for fucking. You are willing to break that constraint. Everyone takes the photo in the Rain Room, the one they’ve all seen before. Tony Robbins. Thought experiment. There are two identical halal carts in Midtown Manhattan but both make the claim that “We Are Different.” Only one has a line. It is 30 meters long. The second barber’s hair is messy. We choose the cart with the line. The line makes it better. It must be different. Cosplay is good, renaissance faires are better. Will I like me when I’m 38? There are about 2,050,000 results when I search for “iPhone 7 unboxing.” Celebrity Net Worth Dot Com. I read a theory that Justin Bieber put on a plastic penis for the filming of the video of his nude body that leaked on the web because the bigger penis would help him be more famous for a longer time. We all already watched the video, we all conferred about it. I can’t find the thing I found. I write this with a computer because it is faster. I write this on a keyboard connected to my computer via bluetooth. My mom says wireless signals are burning us from the inside out. I write this in a Google Doc inside of Google Chrome inside of Mac OS X on top of ones and zeros oscillating on top of a silicon plate that gets hot against the skin on my wrist. Where is the cloud? Is it underground? It is illegal to use unlicensed photographs for your commercial project but you can upload a video of an unlicensed photograph to Youtube and legally use a screenshot from the video because the act of making the screenshot is the act of creating a work of art. There is a $9 rainbow bagel in Brooklyn: it is a work of art. Money on the Mirror on the Ground. When I typed “iPhone 7” Youtube suggested “iPhone 7 official video by apple,” “iPhone 7 review,” “iPhone 7 Jet Black,” and “iPhone 7 Water Test,” among others. A corporation messages you on Facebook: how are you doing. Your dead friend’s dad operates his dead son’s profile, and he checks in with you every few weeks. You message what you think is Facebook’s AI assistant, but there’s a human typing every word. You have your internal self, and how many external selves? What if you were famous? Just TaskRabbit it. There is a mannequin at the physical storefront and a rotatable 3D photoscan of a human being in the digital storefront. I can scan you. We are binge watchers. Random value generator. I am the watcher. I’ve got my fundamental password, I’ve got my password with a special symbol, I’ve got the longer version with an uppercase character, and I made it all up when I was 9. Polyamory’s popularity growth curve is off of the charts. The man from reality tv is the man running for president of reality. Are there more humans or usernames, in total? There are too many versions, it’s too hard to choose, just deliver them in a box every month, but can I provide feedback when I don’t like it? The reality tv show where they competed to be the most obedient, the best money maker that produced no value: the leader of that one. I still have a taste. There are 43,912 Subway Restaurants worldwide and they all smell the same. They are all green. Curation is the new Creation. I have the right to choose. My parents refinanced the mortgage on their home like 3 times and they still sold it. There is one bad Jared but there are hundreds of thousands of mass produced Jared-branded lapel pins. I have the right to choose my best self. I'm so lucky to work in creative. I lance the sickness with my beak. The best house flippers buy houses from lesser flippers and flip and flip and flip them again. To be my best self. Do you remember that guy, from the commercial? There is a higher layer to this maze. I recently read Freedom. Do you remember that thing, from the commercial? Do you remember the name of the person you just met? She reminds you of someone you’ve seen before. Reverse image search her later. I’m convinced that I could grind for 10 years in the ad world and realize substantial success. What does your Nike top say about you? ASMR is the closest thing to having sex with a product that someone can reach without having to deal with the consequences of other people or themselves thinking that they are having sex with a product. Creative Director, do I have it in me? If I sleep for 4 hours tonight I can get more work done and put it on my website. What does your Nike top say about me? Your dog died but you can get a new one. You can use the same leash.
